Blueprint Variable Node Creation Issue - Research Findings

1. ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Blueprint variable getter/setter actions are now properly discovered via search_blueprint_actions
- However, the create_node_by_action_name function fails when trying to create nodes for these variables
- Tested with: create_node_by_action_name(blueprint_name="BP_TestActor", function_name="Get MyTestScore")
- Result: Returns empty error response, node creation fails

2. CONTEXT:
- This issue was discovered during testing of the Blueprint variable search fixes
- The search functionality now works perfectly and returns proper variable actions
- The returned actions include metadata like: function_name="Get MyTestScore", node_type="UK2Node_VariableGet"
- But attempting to create nodes from these discovered actions fails

3. SUSPECTED ROOT CAUSES:

A) Function Name Mismatch:
   - The create_node_by_action_name may expect different function naming patterns
   - Variable getters/setters might need special handling vs regular function calls

B) Node Type Handling:
   - UK2Node_VariableGet/UK2Node_VariableSet may require different creation logic
   - The current implementation might only handle UK2Node_CallFunction nodes properly

C) Variable Reference Resolution:
   - Variable nodes need to reference the specific Blueprint variable
   - May require additional parameter passing (variable_name, variable_guid, etc.)

D) Blueprint Context Issues:
   - Variable nodes might need the target Blueprint to be loaded and active
   - Context switching or Blueprint compilation state issues

4. TESTING EVIDENCE:
- Successful search: search_blueprint_actions("MyTestScore", blueprint_name="BP_TestActor")
  Returns: {"function_name": "Get MyTestScore", "node_type": "UK2Node_VariableGet", "variable_name": "MyTestScore"}
- Failed creation: create_node_by_action_name(blueprint_name="BP_TestActor", function_name="Get MyTestScore") 
  Returns: {"status": "error", "error": ""}

5. AREAS REQUIRING INVESTIGATION:

A) C++ CreateNodeByActionName Implementation:
   - Check how UK2Node_VariableGet/Set nodes are handled
   - Verify if variable node creation has different requirements
   - Review parameter passing for variable-specific metadata

B) Variable Node Creation Process:
   - Understand how Unreal creates variable getter/setter nodes natively
   - Identify required parameters for variable node spawning
   - Check if Blueprint variable GUID or reference is needed

C) Blueprint Context and State:
   - Verify Blueprint loading state during node creation
   - Check if Blueprint needs to be compiled or in specific state
   - Investigate Blueprint graph context requirements

6. NEXT STEPS NEEDED:
- Review CreateNodeByActionName C++ implementation for variable node handling
- Add specific logic for UK2Node_VariableGet/UK2Node_VariableSet creation
- Ensure variable reference resolution and parameter passing
- Test node creation for different variable types (Integer, String, Boolean)
- Verify Blueprint state requirements during node creation

7. CURRENT STATE:
✅ Blueprint variable discovery: WORKING PERFECTLY
❌ Blueprint variable node creation: FAILING
- Search functionality provides all necessary metadata
- Node creation logic needs enhancement for variable nodes
- Issue isolated to create_node_by_action_name function
