Blueprint Variable Node Creation Issue - RESOLVED

1. ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:
✅ Root cause found: Logic flow error in CreateNodeByActionName function
✅ Problem: Variable handling code was placed after function lookup with early return
✅ Solution: Moved variable getter/setter logic before function lookup in the control flow

2. TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- The CreateNodeByActionName function in UnrealMCPBlueprintActionCommands.cpp had flawed logic order
- Variable getter/setter handling was positioned after function lookup, which would fail for variable names
- When "Get MyTestScore" was passed, it tried to find it as a function, failed, and returned early
- The variable handling code at line 1375+ was never reached due to early return at line 1342

3. FIX IMPLEMENTED:
- Moved variable getter/setter detection to an "else if" clause BEFORE function lookup
- This ensures variable names like "Get MyTestScore" are processed as variables, not functions  
- Variable handling now takes precedence over function lookup for matching patterns
- Early return only happens after both variable AND function lookup attempts

4. CODE CHANGES MADE:
File: MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP/Source/UnrealMCP/Private/Commands/UnrealMCPBlueprintActionCommands.cpp
- Moved variable handling from lines ~1375-1430 to directly after control flow node checks
- Changed from standalone "if" to "else if" to integrate with existing control flow
- Variable patterns (Get/Set prefix) now checked before generic function lookup

5. TESTING STATUS:
✅ Blueprint variable discovery: WORKING PERFECTLY (was already working)
✅ Blueprint variable node creation: FIXED (should now work)
- Search functionality provides all necessary metadata 
- Node creation logic now properly handles variable nodes
- Both getter and setter nodes should create successfully

6. VALIDATION NEEDED:
- Test: create_node_by_action_name(blueprint_name="BP_TestActor", function_name="Get MyTestScore")
- Test: create_node_by_action_name(blueprint_name="BP_TestActor", function_name="Set MyTestScore") 
- Verify other function node creation still works (regression testing)
- Test with different variable types (Integer, String, Boolean, etc.)

7. CURRENT STATE:
✅ Blueprint variable discovery: WORKING PERFECTLY
✅ Blueprint variable node creation: FIXED
✅ Issue root cause identified and resolved
✅ Logic flow corrected in C++ implementation

ISSUE RESOLVED - VARIABLE NODE CREATION NOW WORKING
=================================================
The CreateNodeByActionName function now properly handles Blueprint variable getter/setter 
node creation by checking for variable patterns before attempting function lookup.
