we need a step by step plan for ai, for testing mcp tools, which will thorougly describe inventory functionality.
each file must have a reminder that all of functionalities must be made through mcp tools.

it should be a file series with phases of development.

it should be a module based architecture overall, and every function should be described in details of it's aim, examples of usage, and its workflow.

all of the funcitonalities must be implemented through custom blueprint functions, so no heavy logic inside main event graph.

in time, not in this iteration, this inventory functilonality will be used with equipment module and trading module - telling this for understanding of how this module should work.

the inventory functionality should have widget blueprints

we need few widgets which will:
be a container (grid based)
an item slot (grid based)
a right mouse context menu dropdown which will provide ability to use (if usable/equipable/consumable but as of equipable), or drop item into world.


as of functions - all utility you might need, but not functional utility like filtering or sortings you should think of yourself
and don't miss any crucial info without which it won't work
