# Documentation Improvements Summary

## Overview

Based on the integration testing report findings, we have improved the technical API documentation for AI assistants to address common issues and provide better guidance.

## Files Updated

### 1. Docs/Tools/blueprint_action_tools.md

**Improvements Made:**
- ✅ Added **REQUIRED** markers for mandatory parameters
- ✅ Added "Common Issues" sections with specific error cases
- ✅ Added practical examples from real testing scenarios
- ✅ Added troubleshooting section with common errors and solutions
- ✅ Added best practices for function name discovery
- ✅ Added debugging workflow steps
- ✅ Clarified kwargs parameter requirement and usage

**Key Issues Addressed:**
- Function name discovery problems ("Add to Viewport" vs "AddToViewport")
- Missing class_name requirements for certain functions
- Custom event and cast node creation examples
- Blueprint compilation failure debugging

### 2. Docs/Tools/datatable_tools.md

**Improvements Made:**
- ✅ Added **REQUIRED** markers for mandatory parameters
- ✅ Added critical GUID-based field names explanation
- ✅ Added step-by-step workflow examples from real testing
- ✅ Added troubleshooting section for common DataTable errors
- ✅ Added field name management best practices
- ✅ Added performance considerations and batch operations guidance

**Key Issues Addressed:**
- GUID-based property names confusion
- Required workflow: get_datatable_row_names → use exact field names
- DataTable path resolution issues
- Field name caching strategies

### 3. Docs/Tools/actor_tools.md

**Improvements Made:**
- ✅ Added missing light property functions (set_light_property)
- ✅ Added spawn_actor and spawn_blueprint_actor documentation
- ✅ Added **REQUIRED** markers for mandatory parameters
- ✅ Added light property reference with common values
- ✅ Added troubleshooting section for actor-related errors
- ✅ Added debugging workflow for actor operations

**Key Issues Addressed:**
- Missing documentation for light property functions
- Light color format issues
- Actor spawning parameter requirements
- Blueprint path resolution problems

## Common Patterns Added Across All Files

### 1. Parameter Clarity
- **REQUIRED** markers for mandatory parameters
- Clear optional parameter identification
- Data type specifications and format requirements

### 2. Error Handling
- Common error messages and their solutions
- Specific troubleshooting steps
- Best practices to avoid common mistakes

### 3. Practical Examples
- Real-world usage examples from integration testing
- Step-by-step workflows
- Before/after examples showing correct vs incorrect usage

### 4. Debugging Support
- Systematic debugging workflows
- How to verify operations succeeded
- Tools for investigating issues

## Impact on AI Assistant Usage

These improvements should significantly reduce:
- ❌ Trial-and-error attempts due to unclear parameter requirements
- ❌ Function name discovery issues
- ❌ GUID-based field name confusion in DataTables
- ❌ Light property format errors
- ❌ Blueprint compilation failures due to missing connections

And increase:
- ✅ First-attempt success rate for common operations
- ✅ Understanding of required workflows (especially DataTables)
- ✅ Ability to debug and resolve issues independently
- ✅ Confidence in using advanced features like custom events and cast nodes

## Next Steps

The documentation improvements address the major issues identified in the integration testing. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Auto-completion hints**: Adding more specific parameter value examples
2. **Validation helpers**: Tools to check parameter validity before execution
3. **Workflow templates**: Common multi-step operation templates
4. **Error code reference**: Standardized error codes with specific solutions

## Testing Validation

These improvements are based on real errors encountered during comprehensive integration testing of all MCP tool categories. The examples and solutions provided have been validated through actual usage scenarios.
