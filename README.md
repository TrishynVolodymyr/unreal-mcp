## üéÆ Enhanced Input System Integration

The Unreal MCP integration includes comprehensive support for Unreal Engine 5.5+'s Enhanced Input system, providing modern input handling capabilities through natural language commands.

### üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Input Features

| Feature | Description | Example Usage |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Input Action Creation** | Create Enhanced Input Action assets with configurable value types | "Create a digital input action called 'Jump' for jumping mechanics" |
| **Input Mapping Context** | Create Input Mapping Context assets for organized input handling | "Create an input mapping context called 'PlayerContext' for player controls" |
| **Key Mapping Management** | Add key bindings between contexts and actions with modifier support | "Map the Space key to the Jump action in the PlayerContext" |
| **Asset Discovery** | List and query all Enhanced Input assets with metadata | "Show me all Enhanced Input Actions in the project" |
| **Blueprint Integration** | Add Enhanced Input Action event nodes to Blueprint graphs | "Add an Enhanced Input Action node for the Jump action to my player Blueprint" |

### üîß Available Input Value Types

- **Digital**: Simple on/off input (buttons, keys)
- **Analog**: Single-axis input with continuous values (triggers, mouse wheel)
- **Axis2D**: Two-dimensional input (mouse movement, gamepad sticks)
- **Axis3D**: Three-dimensional input (3D controllers, VR inputs)

### üéØ Key Features

- **Automatic Asset Naming**: Follows UE conventions with `IA_` and `IMC_` prefixes
- **Modifier Key Support**: Full support for Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Cmd modifiers
- **Asset Persistence**: Proper UE 5.5 asset creation workflow ensuring assets are saved correctly
- **Metadata Extraction**: Complete asset information including mappings, value types, and descriptions
- **Blueprint Node Support**: Create Enhanced Input Action event nodes for Blueprint scripting
- **Path Management**: Automatic directory creation and organized asset placement

### üîç Example Natural Language Commands

```
"Create a digital Enhanced Input Action called 'Interact' for player interactions"

"Create an input mapping context called 'MainGameplay' for core game controls"

"Map the E key to the Interact action in the MainGameplay context"

"Add the F key with Shift modifier to the Jump action"

"Show me all Enhanced Input Actions in the /Game/Input directory"

"List all Input Mapping Contexts and their current key mappings"

"Add an Enhanced Input Action event node for the Jump action to my PlayerBlueprint"
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

The Enhanced Input integration includes:

#### **C++ Plugin Components**:
- `HandleCreateEnhancedInputAction`: Creates Input Action assets with proper UE 5.5 workflow
- `HandleCreateInputMappingContext`: Creates Input Mapping Context assets with package management
- `HandleAddMappingToContext`: Manages key mappings using FEnhancedActionKeyMapping system
- `HandleListInputActions`: Asset discovery with metadata extraction and filtering
- `HandleListInputMappingContexts`: Context enumeration with complete mapping details

#### **Python MCP Tools**:
- `create_enhanced_input_action`: Python wrapper for Input Action creation
- `create_input_mapping_context`: Python wrapper for Mapping Context creation
- `add_mapping_to_context`: Key mapping management with modifier support
- `list_input_actions`: Asset listing with path filtering capabilities
- `list_input_mapping_contexts`: Context discovery with mapping enumeration

#### **Asset Management**:
- Proper package creation and asset registry integration
- Asset persistence using target packages instead of transient packages
- Automatic asset naming with UE conventions (`IA_`, `IMC_` prefixes)
- Directory creation and path management for organized asset structure

### üîÑ Backward Compatibility

The Enhanced Input tools work alongside existing legacy input mapping functionality, allowing projects to:
- Migrate gradually from legacy input to Enhanced Input
- Use both systems simultaneously during transition
- Maintain existing legacy input mappings while adding Enhanced Input features

This integration provides a complete Enhanced Input toolset that modernizes input handling capabilities while preserving compatibility with existing input systems.

### MCP Configuration Locations

Depending on which MCP client you're using, the configuration file location will differ:

| MCP Client | Configuration File Location | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\claude-desktop\mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Located in your project root directory |
| Windsurf | `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\windsurf\mcp.json` |

Each client uses the same JSON format as shown in the example above. 
Simply place the configuration in the appropriate location for your MCP client.
